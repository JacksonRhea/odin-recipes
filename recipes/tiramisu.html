    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Tiramisu is an elegant and rich layered Italian dessert made with delicate ladyfinger cookies, espresso or instant espresso, mascarpone cheese, eggs, sugar, Marsala wine, rum and cocoa powder. Through the grouping of these diverse ingredients, an intense yet refined dish emerges.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brandy</li>
            <li>2 cups brewed espresso, cooled, divided</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>30 ladyfingers (such as Savoiardi®)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Beat 1/2 cup sugar, egg yolks, brandy, and 1 tablespoon espresso together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mascarpone cheese to sugar-egg mixture and beat until well blended, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Beat egg whites and a pinch sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gently fold egg whites into mascarpone mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pour remaining espresso into a shallow dish. Dip 1 side of each ladyfinger into the espresso and arrange on a serving platter in 2 horizontal rows of 6 with 2 1/2 ladyfingers in opposite direction on both ends to form a rectangular shape.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfinger layer and dust with 1/2 of the cocoa powder. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers dipped in espresso, mascarpone mixture, and cocoa powder. Refrigerate tiramisu until ladyfingers have softened from the espresso and mascarpone mixture, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
