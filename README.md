This is the readme I made in git and will be uing various git commands I just learned to commit and push from my local machine to my online repo.

Afterwards the project will be in HTML where I have to make a small recipe webpage uing various skills such as headers, paragraphs, anchors, images, links, and many more technical things that every webpage requires. Right now my understanding of HTML is limited as I have just started but I will update this README with what I ended up learning by the end of this project.
